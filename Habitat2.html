<h1 style="color:Green;">Rain Forest Habitat</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/rain-forest">
    Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest grow very tall because they have to compete with other plants for sunlight.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:Green;">Red-Eyed Tree Frog</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/red-eyed-tree-frog">Being green helps the red-eyed tree frog blend in with tree leaves.Feeding on tiny insects, the tadpoles live in the water they fell into until they metamorphose, or develop, into little brown froglets. At this point they leave the water and climb up nearby trees to live as tree frogs.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:Green;">Orangutan</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/orangutan">Though an adult male orangutan can weigh up to 220 pounds (100 kilograms)—females weigh about half what males do—orangutans spend most of their time up in the trees. They are the largest of all arboreal animals.</blockquote>
