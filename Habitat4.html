<h1 style="color:Yellow;">Temperate Forest Habitat</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/temperate-forest" style="color:DarkGrey;">Dry leaves crunch under your feet as you walk through the woods.
    The air is crisp and cool. The sun shines through the orange, red, and gold leaves. Itâ€™s autumn and the forest is popping with color.
    Because the weather changes with the seasons, the animals that live in temperate forests have adaptations that allow them to survive in different kinds of weather.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:#ff5802;">Chipmunk</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/chipmunk" style="color:DarkGrey;">Chipmunks are part of the squirrel family, and while they look similar to their bushy-tailed cousins,
    chipmunks are actually smaller, with alternating light and dark stripes along their cheeks and backs.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:Green;">Bobcat</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bobcat" style="color:DarkGrey;">Bobcats may look cute and cuddly, but these felines that live throughout North America are actually fierce predators.
    They can leap as far as 12 feet to catch prey and have been known to take down much larger animals, such as young deer.</blockquote>
