<h1 style="color:Blue;">Ocean Habitat</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/ocean">From outer space Earth looks like an awesome blue marble. That’s because most of Earth’s surface—more than 70 percent—is covered by oceans.
    Scientists estimate that about one million species of animals live in the ocean.</blockquote>

     <h2 style="color:Blue;">Jellyfish</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/jellyfish">Jellyfish have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth.
    The jellylike creatures pulse along on ocean currents and are abundant in cold and warm ocean water, in deep water, and along coastlines.
    But despite their name, jellyfish aren't actually fish—they're invertebrates, or animals with no backbones.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:Blue;">Great White Shark</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/great-white-shark">When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother.
    Born on the east and west coasts of North America, the south of Africa and southwest Australia, baby sharks are on their own right from the start. Their mother may see them only as prey.</blockquote>
